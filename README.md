# recursive-reverse
Class Reverser contains two methods:

# Reverse, that given a sentence and a pre-defined set of word separator characters, 
reverses all the words without altering their ordinal position in the sentence, while keeping the same separator characters 
in their original position.

ReverseSentence, that given a sentence and a pre-defined set of word separator characters, 
reverses the order of the words in the sentence without reversing each word.
Separator characters are kept in their original position.

For each method a unit test class is provided. Unit tests in these classes can be referred too 
as a more detailed specification of the behavior of the methods.
